# project-alpha
## An initial exploration of end to end data collection, processing, analysis and learning.

Goals:
1. Resource an interesting and relevant public data source.
2. Apply data transformations to be suitable for an ML model.
3. Make design decisions based on EDA.
4. Fine tune a base model or perhaps a downstream fine tuned model using the data set.
5. Create a learner.
6. Learn.
7. Evaluate results of the best performing model. Include logic to identify the highest performance.
