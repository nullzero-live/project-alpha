# project-alpha
## An initial exploration of self-driven end to end data collection, processing, analysis and learning. Applying learnt methods to a full pipeline using the messy data of 'the real world.' I will perform end-end project research, data collection, framework selection, model and all other factors based on the wisdom of the hive mind that is the internet. My goal is to experience the 

Sub-Goals:
1. Resource an interesting and relevant public data source.
2. Apply data transformations to be suitable for an ML model.
3. Make design decisions based on EDA.
4. Fine tune a base model or perhaps a downstream fine tuned model using the data set.
5. Create a learner.
6. Learn.
7. Evaluate results of the best performing model. Include logic to identify the highest performance.
8. Save model and weights.
9. Deployment on HF Spaces

BONUS: Integrate LangChain Chains into the pipeline for inference.
